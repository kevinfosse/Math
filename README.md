# Math
My first tool created in C++ to calculate delta in polynomial functions


This software is for me a way to train in C++, this new version is the result of my research and my learning from books, it remains very simple but it makes me proud to publish it.

Windows user: You will probably have to add systems ("pause") because on MacOS I didn't need them...


To compile it you will need a compiler like g++ or gcc

"g++ /SourceFolders/main.cpp -o outputName"
